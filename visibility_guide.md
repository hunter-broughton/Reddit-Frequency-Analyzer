# Make Your GitHub Release More Visible

Here are several strategies to make your release and data files more discoverable:

## 1. 📌 Pin the Release
- Go to your releases page: https://github.com/hunter-broughton/Reddit-Frequency-Analyzer/releases

- This makes it appear prominently on your repository's main page

## 2. 🏷️ Add Release Badges to README
Add these badges to the top of your README.md:

[![Data Available](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reddit%20Data-Available-brightgreen)](https://github.com/hunter-broughton/Reddit-Frequency-Analyzer/releases/latest)
```
